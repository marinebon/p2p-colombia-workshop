The purpose is to continue the development of a community of practice dedicated to understanding change in marine biodiversity and generating knowledge and products that inform conservation and management efforts across the Americas. During this workshop participants will: Learn to survey rocky shores using photo-quadrat collection and imagery analysis; Develop specific Dawin Core vocabularies for flora and fauna of rocky shore and sandy beach measured during field surveys; Publish survey datasets collected during 2019 and 2020 to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS); Analyze survey data collected since NaGISA to the present to examine biogeographical patterns and detect biodiversity change in coastal communities; Seagrasses - TBD Tayrona National Park 1.2 Logistics Workshop dates: May 4-8, 2020 (+2 days for travel) Venue: Marine and Coastal Research Institute “José Benito Vives de Andréis” (INVEMAR) Santa Marta Magdalena, Colombia 1.3 Organizers Marine Biodiversity Observation Network Pole to Pole of the Americas - MBON Pole to Pole Marine and Coastal Research Institute “José Benito Vives de Andréis” (INVEMAR) AmeriGEO - Group on Earth Observations Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS; IOC-UNESCO) Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS; IOC-UNESCO) Ocean Best Practice System (OBPS; IOC-UNESCO) Ocean Teacher Global Academy (OTGA) 1.4 Workshop rationale The MBON Pole to Pole is organizing a third Marine Biodiversity Workshop - From the Sea to the Cloud after two successful workshops held in Brazil and Mexico since 2018. This activity advances the implementation of the MBON Pole to Pole network by enhancing knowledge on field data collection methods and use of informatic technologies for data management and analysis. The MBON Pole to Pole aims to address the biodiversity priorities of various GEO initiatives, including GEO Blue Planet and AmeriGEO, and coordinates with the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Ocean Best Practice System (OBPS) of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, OBIS, and other national and international groups to serve the broadest possible community. This network aims to help nations and regions to improve conservation planning and environmental impact mitigation, serve the scientific community, and satisfy commitments to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), Aichi Targets of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s). The MBON Pole to Pole workshops: enhance coordination of data collection among nations; improve the collection of harmonized data, developing data standards and methodologies for data management and dissemination without compromising national concerns; support the integration of biodiversity information with physical and chemical data over time (status and trends); and generates products needed for informed policy and management of the ocean. The workshop targets investigators and resource managers dedicated to studying and conserving biodiversity of invertebrates in three important coastal habitats: rocky shore intertidal zone, sandy beaches and seagrass beds (in collaboration with MarineGEO). This activity targets participants from all nations in the Americas, from pole to pole. 1.5 Instructors Enrique Montes (IMaRS; USF) - Project lead and workshop coordinator Patricia Miloslavich (SCOR) - TBD Emmett Duffy (MarineGEO) - TBD Lauren Weatherdon (UNEP-WCMC) - TBD Maria Kavanaugh (OSU, USA) - Satellite biogeography (seascape maps) Eduardo Klein (OBIS) - Darwin Core (DwC), WoRMS species catalog for taxonomic quality control, and OBIS tools Ben Best (Ecoquants) - Data wrangling, visualization and analysis with R software, collaborative research platforms (Github, Git, RMarkdown) Jonathan Lefchek (MarineGEO - Smithsonian I.) - Data science tools for seagrass ecology and biodiversity Abigail Benson (OBIS-USA; USGS) - Darwin Core (DwC)** Sennai Habtes (UVI) - Statistical applications in coastal ecology and biodiversity assessments Frank Muller-Karger (IMaRS; USF) - Satellite remote sensing Brian Helmuth (Northeastern University, USA) - Drivers of biodiversity variability and change in the rocky shore intertidal zone Others?

Install additional packages by running the following line of code in your R terminal: source(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marinebon/p2p-brazil-workshop/master/scripts/install-R-packages.R&quot;) Sampling protocol for assessment of marine diversity on rocky shores. (Modified from the SARCE South American Research Group on Coastal Ecosystems for sampling on rocky shores protocol) Sampling protocol for assessment of marine diversity on sandy beaches Step-by-step taxonomy quality control with WoRMS HOW TO upload and publish your data in OBIS and GBIF MarineGEO Seagrass Monitoring Protocol Neoprene boots. Tayrona National Park 1.7 Eligibility The workshop will be limited to 15 participants. Selection of participants will be based on results from the Application Survey (below) and their ability and willingness to openly share data through OBIS, sustain a collaborative long-term monitoring program in their study area, share best practices and contribute to achieving the overall goals of the MBON Pole to Pole. Priority will be given to participants of the previous workshop that conducted biodiversity surveys at their study sites and that have already submitted data to OBIS. Applicants willing to use and share their own data are also eligible if specific information about their dataset is provided, study site(s) location(s), time span of their dataset and methods employed. 1.8 Survey - THIS IS BEING UPDATED In order to partcipate, you will need to complete the Application Survey below (be sure to scroll down within frame), or by visiting the survey directly at https://forms.gle/e3Wi23k53psARePo6, before the survey deadline of January 17, 2020 at 11:59pm (EST). Loading… 1.9 Confirmation The Application Survey will be closed January 31, 2020, at midnight (EST). Candidates will receive notice of acceptance by February 28th, 2020. Selected participants must confirm attendance to the workshop by replying to the acceptance notification email before March 20, 2020. The workshop will provide partial or full travel support to a selected number of participants. Priority for travel suppor will be given to participants that: have submitted biodiversity survey data to OBIS; have completed at least one biodiversity surveys at their study sites in 2019; are able to bring previously collected biodiversity survey data to the workshop; are willing to upload their data to OBIS; 1.10 Resources OBIS Manual Ocean Best Practice System R for Data Science Spatial Data Analysis and Modeling with R Species Distribution Modeling with R Ocean Teacher Global Academy (OTGA) 1.11 Materials and outputs from the previous workshop (April 2-5, 2019) 2nd Marine Biodiversity Worshop: from the Sea to the Cloud - Report from Mexico Participants list Agenda Course materials on Ocean Teacher Global Academy 360 Virtual Tour at workshop site The project is supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant 80NSSC18K0318, ” Laying the foundations of the Pole-to-Pole Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) of the Americas”, and co-sponsored by AmeriGEO.
